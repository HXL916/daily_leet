# Problem
621. Task Scheduler

# Description
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char task : tasks) freq[task - 'A']++;

        int maxFreq = *max_element(freq.begin(), freq.end());
        int maxFreqCount = count(freq.begin(), freq.end(), maxFreq);
        int idleSlots = (maxFreq - 1) * (n + 1 - maxFreqCount);
        idleSlots = max(0, idleSlots - (int)(tasks.size() - maxFreq * maxFreqCount));

        return tasks.size() + idleSlots;
    }
};
