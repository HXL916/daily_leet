# Problem
791. Custom Sort String

# Description
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

 

 
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> count;
        std::string result;

        for (char c : s) {
            count[c]++;
        }

        for (char c : order) {
            if (count.find(c) != count.end()) {
                result.append(count[c], c);
                count[c] = 0;
            }
        }
        for (const auto& pair : count) {
            if (pair.second > 0) {
                result.append(pair.second, pair.first);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```
