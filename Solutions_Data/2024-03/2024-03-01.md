# Problem
2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number

# Description
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        if(s.length() == 1) return "1";
        int cpt = 0;
        for(char& c: s){
            if(c == '1')
                cpt++;
        }
        string answer;
        cpt--;
        for(int i = 1; i< s.size(); i++){
            if(cpt>0){
                answer += '1';
                cpt--;
            }else{
                answer += '0';
            }
        }
        answer += '1';
        return answer;

    }
};
```
